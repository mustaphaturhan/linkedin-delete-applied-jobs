# Delete LinkedIn Applied Jobs - This isn't working anymore.
### How to install?
Go to [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and download LTS one. After install, go to terminal and clone this repository by writing:
`git clone https://github.com/mustaphaturhan/linkedin-delete-applied-jobs.git`
When cloning is done, write
```
cd linkedin-delete-applied-jobs
npm install
npm start or node index.js
```
Terminal will ask you two things:
- What is your email?
- What is your password?

After answer this questions, process will start. Process can be take little time but don't forget: this is my first web automation work.

### To LinkedIn
Hey guys! I don't know there is something about automations on your TOS but if you want remove this repository; just contact: [odunluzikkim@gmail.com](mailto:odunluzikkim@gmail.com)

But please... I have job applications I applied 1 years ago in "applied job" list and this isn't make sense. Why a company holding my CV for 1 year in your system? I'm not selected for that job obviously; so just delete my application.

#### To-do

- [ ] Error handling. There is no error handler now.
